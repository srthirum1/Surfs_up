    - We can conclude based on these averages that it might be a good idea to take a look at percipitation over the year as well before concluding that this business is sustaibale year-round. Though the weather looks good, if it rains heavily then it might not look so good for business.

    - Overall the results look the same for both months, avg temp of around the 70s, where june has more data points to take from vs dec. Some additional queries I would preform in the future would be to take a look at the other months year round, take a look at percipitation so that rain doesn't factor in for bad business or lack of. Take a look at percipitation at different locations as well to see if they vary and then determine if this business is sustainable or not.
